A strong movement is in motion for humans to move off-Earth and start living in space, both on space based stations and on other celestial bodies. 
Of the other celestial bodies, the Moon is the first and most logical target for human settling.
Research in many different areas of science has been ongoing in laboratories and simulation facilities on Earth for many years, as well as in
Low Earth Orbit (LEO) space station facilities, to learn about how humans can survive and thrive off-Earth.
This includes studying how plants grow in off-planet conditions.
One aspect of this research is the cultivation of plants for growing food,
which is an imperative for any successful off-planet settlement. 
Obviously, fast growing foods with high nutritious content (tomato, carrot, lettuce, spinach, etc.),
as well as herbs and mushrooms that can be used for seasoning, and possibly medicine, have been the main focus.

The goal of this experiment is to study in what way the **Camellia Sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze** (variety **Sinensis**,
see `ITIS <https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&search_value=530945#null>`_),
better known as the tea plant, could be cultivated on the Moon.
The Camellia Sinensis is an evergreen shrub of the Theaceae Family.
It is neither fast growing, nor specifically nutritious, so that it will not be the first choice when considering plants to grow off-planet.
It does have beneficial health characteristics (*i.e.* anti-oxidants), the scientific literature on the topic is vast
(for example :ref:`Greyling et al. 2014 <greyling2014>`, :ref:`Iwai et al. 2002 <iwai2002>`, :ref:`Khan and Mukhtar 2013 <khan2013>`, 
:ref:`Wang et al. 2020 <wang2020>`). 
In addition, the preparation and drinking of made tea (tea leaves ready for brewing) can have a positive calming socio-psychological effect.
Tea has been praised for these characteristics for millennia.
Together with the cultural value of tea world wide this make it worth studying the potential for growing and cultivating Camellia Sinensis
(both the Sinensis and the Assamica variety) on the Moon.
 

Part 0 of this experiment is the determination of some baseline growth parameters under normal conditions, though it can argued that growing
the tea plants in pots on a balcony in a city is not quite “normal”: it would have better in a field, but this beyond the possibilities at this time.
This first part of the experiment ran from early March through early September 2021 with a set of six plants.
Considering its huge economic importance the tea plant has been studied very extensively for the past two centuries at least.
A good review is given by T.E.T. Bond  (:ref:`Bond 1942 <bond1942>`, :ref:`Bond 1945 <bond1945>`) who writes from Ceylon (Ski Lanka) about
the general growth of the healthy tea plant, more in particular the Assamica variety which is the main variety cultivated in Sri Lanka, India and
Indonesia.
:ref:`Wijeratne (2001) <wijeratne2001>`, working with the Tea Research Institute in Sri Lanka, provides with a more recent general description, also based on the
Assamica variety.
In my experiments I use the Sinensis variety, which I understand is a more sturdy plant in that it can handle larger local climate differences
(temperature, humidity levels, etc..) and therefore perhaps better suited for space cultivation. 
Another difference with (at least some of) the studies published in the scientific literature is that (for now) I am not handling the tea plant
as it would be handled for tea farming, that is I am not plucking shoots, rather I let the plants grow naturally. 
I felt the strong need to do my own experiments on the Sinensis variety to get values for the typical parameters (growth rates, leaf lengths, etc.)
and to “get to know” the plants and the way they behave.
