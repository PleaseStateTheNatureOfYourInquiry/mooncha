The Zeroth experiment - Part 2
==============================

Between November 2021 and July 2022 I performed additional experiments with a new set of young tea plants from `Chá Camélia <https://chacamelia.com/>`_ 
in Northern Portugal. 
Due to severe limitations in my time I did not manage to do any measurements this time, I took a more qualitative approach. 
Below are observations and descriptions.

I carried (on the plane) eight new plants from Portugal to the Netherlands on Monday 1 November 2021.
Until today the plants have been at the balcony in Haarlem, catching fresh air (temperatures between 5˚C and 15˚C) and humidity.
Today I take the plants to Rotterdam where I have been preparing their arrival, testing water wick systems in pots with (clay??) pebbles (01 testing water wicks).

I purchased `hydroponics nutrition 4-18-38 <https://www.hydroponicseurope.nl/product/masterblend-4-18-38-hydroponic-plantenvoeding-set-0-5-2-kg/>`_
to mix with water from Hydroponics Europe.
I prepare 10 liters of nutritious water (**n-water**) with the correct amounts from the three bags (see photo 02 nutrition mix powders) using lukewarm water. 

I take two of the plants and label them shichi (7) and hachi (8), clean them from soil (04 Shichi plant with roots, 05 hatchi plant with roots)
and place them in a pot with cloth wicks and an central olla.
I add pebbles and I hang the pot in the styrofoam box procured from the Erasmus MC trash by Paul :-)!
I pot hangs nicely from the borders of the box and I add **n-water** so that the bottom of the pot is just in the liquid.
I also fill the olla with **n-water**. I cover the olla with another pot to diminiush evaporation.

Finally, I put the cloth around the pot so that the box is effectively sealed.
We will see how efficiently this set up can provide with nutritients and water for the plants.
I think that perhaps the wicks in combination with the centimeter sizes pebbles is not enough?
I notice two days later (18 November), that the level of the olla has decreased a lot less compared to the level of the olla in the normal soil box.
This is easily understood, as the contact area with the pebbles is a lot less compared to the with the soil, so the transfer of water will be less effective.

The other six plants, I do not yet label, and put in normal soil in a styrofoam box with a central olla.
I add a plastic sheet on one end of each box to protect the plants from the constant airflow that comes from the openings of the windowsill. 

Regular wettening will be necessary due to the dry air in the room.
The plants will be receiving a all the light they can get, though no direct sunlight as the window is facing North.

I also cut off the two leaves that show a brown edge (see photos).

The plants have been left to adapt for almost three weeks now.
Paul Knops and I take care of them by spraying water dalily, except on the weekends
(in fact when I am not in the Netherlands, the plants go without spraying for three days, as Paul does not work on Fridays).
Paul refilled the level of the nutrious liquid a bit in the week of 22 November, when I was in Portugal.
I refilled it also the week after. 

It looked to me that the pebble culture pot was too dry, even though the Shichi and Hatchi plants seemed to be fine.
Also, the olla in the pebble pot show a very slow descrease in the water level, which is easy to explain,
because the active surface of the pebbles is large compared to soil grains and thus the water diffuses with much more difficulty.
I thought that by smashing the pebbles to smaller pieces, and refitting the pot, this might help. 

When I took out the plants today, I was surprised to find that the roots were nice and humid (01 roots of Shichi and Hachi plants)
and that the lower layers of pebbles in the pot were also wet. The cloth wick system works pretty good (06 bottom of pot with wet wicks and wet pebbles)!
I smashed up part of the pebbles and then refitted the Shishi and Hatchi plants with the olla now deeper (09 adding olla), next to the roots
(it was not really doing anything at the higher level).
I add the smaller sized pebbles (10 pebble mix different sizes) to that layer and finish off with normal size pebbles to prevent too effective evaporation (?).
I want to let the plants adapt for a while to this new setup.

With this test using water wicks and nutritious liquid, which seems to work quite well, I realise I can fit further pots with Moon and Mars soil simulants.
They are pricey though, I might need to find some funding.

Paul Knops has been treating well of the plants.
They are all in good shape.
I noticed that on most plants, some of the leaves develop the brown edges
(13 Shishi Leaves with Brown Edges, 14 Hachi Leaves with Brown Edges and 16 Plants in Earth Pot).
I must ask the team from Chá Camélia about this, because I think this must be related to the genetic make up of the plants:
all the growing conditions are different than in Portugal!
Also, a few leaves on several plants have small holes in them (15 Holes in Hachi Leaves): something is eating, but I am not sure what insect.

One of the plants from the previous batch, which I cut to a stomp, and which we keep in a large pot away from the window,
has been developping beautiful leaves! 
I plan to move it to the pot close to the window and see what happens. It is rather amazing how strong these plants are (see photos 10 Stomp Growing 00 (20211207) from 7 December 2021, 11 Stomp Growing 01 and 12 Stomp Growing 02 from 5 January 2022).

Paul also found a 6 liter tank (01 Aquarium side, 02 Aquarium top).
He tested to make sure it is watertight. I decided to use it to set up a small aquaponics system, with one or perhaps two plants.
I got an airpump (04 Air Pump and SuperFish Airflow 1) and also a simple water filter system
(03 Aquarium WaterFlow Pump without Filter Sponge and `link <https://www.amazon.co.uk/Superfish-Internal-Filters-Aqua-Filter/dp/B003ZGAI12>`_).
I use the pump of this system (not the filter sponge, which I simply take out from the filter container) to pump water from the tank through the plant pot. The tank has two holes in the side: one is taped off.
The other hole I use to create a connection through where I can pump the aquarium water to the plant pot.
I cannot raise the tube too high, as the pump is rather weak.
I use the rod with tiny water holes that comes as part of the pump set to place inside the pot (05 Large Plastic Pot with Connection to Rod, 06 Rod wth Tiny Water Holes). After quite a bit of fiddling and fitting and improving,
I arrive at a system that works (07 Pot Connected, 08 Water Flowing through Pot, 09 Full Setup).
I will put a timer and perhaps have the filter run for one hour per day, in the morning.

The tank holds about 5.1 liter of water  (2.4dm x 1.65dm x 1.3dm). I use tap water that I filtered through a Brita filter.
This lowers the pH from about 8.7 to about 7. I place the tank near the window and the water temperature is 15˚C. 

I add 5ml of `Tetra Safe Start <https://www.petsplace.nl/tetra-aqua-safestart-waterverbeteraars-m-4004218161146-pps>`_) to prepare the water to receive fish.
I also added three small plants. Since the water temperature is quite low, I will need to work with gold fish. I think two or three is maximum.

There are now three set-ups: aquaponics, hydroponics with water wicks and normal soil with water wicks. All setups have been steady for two months now. 
Here is a video of the setup taken in January:

.. youtube:: BdVfytD_yBk

|


The normal soil setup has the plants which seem to be the dyest, with falling leaves.
Though at this stage, a strong apical growing can be seen at most plants. 

The aquaponics setup has the "happiest" plants and the two small have been very lively and happy. 
The system has been stable since 14-01-2022 and the fish are fed very little three times a week.
The system pumps the full aquarium volumne (about 5l) through the plants every other hour during day-time
(six times a day at 7-8, 9-10, 11-12, 13-14, 15-16, 17-18).
The water temperatures has been fluctuating as a function of the outside temperature, because of it position near the window, between 16˚C and 20˚C.
The fish do not seem to mind. Algae have grown under the influence of light from outside.
Paul cleaned the whole aquarium two weeks ago. He noted that he water was very clear (!), only the insides of the walls had algae.
Three sides have now been blocked from the outside light with carton board, one side (towards the room) is open.
After a week, there were food rests that had developed a fluffy sphere around them (see 20220120 fluffy food rests 01 and 20220120 fluffy food rests 02).
After removing most of them, these did not come back, perhaps also because we decreased the feeding rate and quantity from daily to three times a week.

All plants show signs of apical and lateral sprouting.

I have decided to stop the experiment at this point.
The reference plants in the normal soil have had too much stress and all plants are too much dried out, except for the plants in the aquaponics!
In the dry air conditions in the lab in Rotterdam, a closed-off small greenhouse with moistering would be needed.
Also, I do not have enough time in the sense of being present in the lab.

I have placed all the plants in the big deep pot with normal soil and keep watering them.
In fact, one of the plants from the first part, that I also placed here last year, and that has totally dried out and died, or so it seemed,
has produced a complete new sprout that looks amazingly good (20220509 amazing new plant from first part) ...
and without Paul and I paying much attention to watering and caring at all!!
Amazing.

.. admonition: Lessons learnt

    * aquaponics works really well, in that the plants stay very watered and look healthy. I did not see much growth starting, but it might have needed more time. Definitely an avenue to explore further. Also, the Ju plants grew a new sprout at root level (20220502 Ju roots 01 and 20220502 Ju roots 02).

    * The hydroponics and water wicks also seemed to work well, with plants starting to [ush some new sprouts. But the air was too dry.

The plants have been in the large pot for six weeks now.
All leaves have dried and fallen off, probably too much stress on the plants from changing them around.
But new tiny leaves are seen on the some of the stems.
Also, two larger new plants are growing, from the roots of old plants up (20220614 new plant)
and two tiny ones from the Ju roots (20220614 new Ju plants 01 and 02).

Most interestingly, the leaves do not at all show the brown edges problem that all the other plants had!
