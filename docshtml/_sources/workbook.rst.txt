Rational

A strong movement is in motion for humans to move off-Earth and start living in space, both on space based stations and on other celestial bodies. 
Of the other celestial bodies, the Moon is the first and most logical target for human settling.
Research in many different areas of science has been ongoing in laboratories and simulation facilities on Earth for many years, as well as in
Low Earth Orbit (LEO) space station facilities, to learn about how humans can survive and thrive off-Earth.
This includes studying how plants grow in off-planet conditions.
One aspect of this research is the cultivation of plants for growing food,
which is an imperative for any successful off-planet settlement. 
Obviously, fast growing foods with high nutritious content (tomato, carrot, lettuce, spinach, etc.),
as well as herbs and mushrooms that can be used for seasoning, and possibly medicine, have been the main focus.

The goal of this experiment is to study in what way the **Camellia Sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze** (variety **Sinensis**,
see `ITIS <https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&search_value=530945#null>`_),
better known as the tea plant, could be cultivated on the Moon.
The Camellia Sinensis is an evergreen shrub of the Theaceae Family.
It is neither fast growing, nor specifically nutritious, so that it will not be the first choice when considering plants to grow off-planet.
It does have beneficial health characteristics (*i.e.* anti-oxidants), the scientific literature on the topic is vast
(for example Greyling *et al.* 2014, Iwai *et al.* 2002, Khan and Mukhtar 2013, Wang *et al.* 2020). 
In addition, the preparation and drinking of made tea (tea leaves ready for brewing) can have a positive calming socio-psychological effect.
Tea has been praised for these characteristics for millennia.
Together with the cultural value of tea world wide this make it worth studying the potential for growing and cultivating Camellia Sinensis
(both the Sinensis and the Assamica variety) on the Moon.
